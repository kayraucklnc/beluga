 * bitmap it was rasterized at and zooming past it just stretches the pixels. So once a zoom or pan settles,
 * nudge the layer: for two frames it gets `translateZ(0)` and then loses it, which makes WebKit rebuild its
 * backing at the current scale. Chromium re-rasterizes on its own; there the nudge is harmless.
 *
 * Call inside a ReactFlowProvider. Keep blur (filter, backdrop-filter) off anything inside the viewport.
