 * (each optional), notifications, the phone app, then the app. It shows
 * once per Mac. Updating the app never brings it back (the mark is kept with this window's own
 * storage, which an update leaves alone), and someone who used Beluga before it existed never
 * sees it either. File › Onboard Again (or Help › Welcome to Beluga, or the palette) shows it again.
 * Quit halfway (macOS's "Quit & Reopen" after a permission, say) and it opens where it was left.
