/**
 * How every teammate's copy of a task agrees (BLG-222), as pure functions. Each field is
 * last-writer-wins: it carries who set it (`a`, a peer id) and when, in Lamport time (`l`); the
 * higher `l` wins, then the higher `a`, then (never in practice) the larger value, so every Mac
 * picks the same one whatever order changes arrive in. Activity and comments are only ever added
 * (by id), in time order. A deleted task is a field too (`deleted`), so a delete wins or loses
 * like any other change.
 *
 * What travels is the task's words and state only: worktrees, branches, pull requests, proof
 * files and run details stay on the Mac they belong to. "Ata is working on this" is a field of
 * Ata's own (`working.<peerId>`), true while one of Ata's worktrees does it.
