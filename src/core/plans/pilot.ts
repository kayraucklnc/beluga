/**
 * The scheduler: runs approved plans as far as their autonomy allows. It starts what's ready
 * (never more than the plan's limit, never a blocked task, never twice), asks the head Claude to
 * check a milestone once its tasks are finished, passes it on autopilot when the check passed,
 * opens every milestone whose dependencies have passed (independent ones run side by side, each
 * with its own check and pass), and asks for a recap at the end. A task that builds on several
 * unmerged tasks starts from their branches combined (a conflict there goes to the head Claude). Claude can't get around it: starting
 * and passing go through here. It acts a moment after whatever changed (the board, a run, a plan).
 *
 * With git (`git`), the plan owns a branch, plan/<slug> from main: every task starts from it as it is
 * then, a passed milestone's task branches merge into it (its tasks go Merged into Plan, their worktrees are
 * archived and their branches deleted), and the plan ends as one pull request into main, which
 * moves every Merged into Plan task to Done when it merges. Plans that ran before this catch up once.
 *
 * A started task whose Claude stopped without finishing is woken once, and waits for you when it
 * stops again soon after (see watchdog.ts); time alone can stall a turn, so it looks every minute.
 *
 * One Claude per milestone (the default, `workers: 'milestone'`): an open milestone with work
 * ready gets one worktree and one Claude, which does its tasks one after another in the order
 * they build on each other, keeping its context (a worktree per task spent most of its time
 * finding its way around again). Every task links that worktree, and its Claude moves each one
 * along on the board itself (In Progress, its criteria, proof, In Review), so tasks still show
 * one by one. Its turn ending with tasks left, it's sent on (once per step: then it's yours);
 * tasks added later (a failed check's fixes) go to the same Claude. Tasks for you are never
 * its: they wait for you (see PilotDeps.forYou). Milestones still run side by side, the plan's
 * limit counting milestones at work. `workers: 'task'` is the older way: a worktree per task.
