 * What came in which minor, for a phone talking to an older Mac: it subscribes to a topic (and
 * makes a call) only when the Mac's minor has it, since an older Mac drops a `sub` frame naming a
 * topic it doesn't know. 1.3: the relay (any network). 1.4: the tasks topics, `companion.openOnMac`, `companion.icon`, merging
 * from the phone (`companion.mergeCheck` / `merge` / `resolve`), describing a task
 * (`companion.draftTask` / `addTask`) and starting one (`board.start`). 1.5: "Your Mac" (the
 * `conv:mac:assistant` topic, Home's `assistant`), and asking in a project as a new worktree
 * (`workspaces.startWorktree`, with plan mode) or a plan (`plans.create`), besides a question;
 * a plan's dependencies, criteria and autonomy (`PlanView`, `plans.setAutonomy`). 1.6: a
 * worktree's branch state in its conversation (`ConvView.branch`). 1.7 (BLG-42): a worktree's
 * files, read-only (`companion.files.list` / `find` / `read`), and its terminals, shared with the
 * Mac (`companion.terminals` / `termOpen` / `termClose`, the `term_*` frames). 1.8: a branch's every
 * step from the phone, as the Mac's toolbar has them (`BranchView.steps`, `companion.branchStep`).
 * 1.9 (BLG-87): more of Claude's blocks drawn (`tree`, `json`, `terminal`, `math` blocks, mermaid as
 * a graph or view) and its math typeset (`ProseView.math`). 1.10 (BLG-110): a sub-agent opened on
 * the phone, its whole activity and the report it gave back (`companion.subAgent`). 1.11 (BLG-124):
 * which conversations the phone saved files from are archived or deleted (`companion.gone`). 1.12:
 * photos with a new worktree (`companion.ask`'s `worktree` target). 1.13 (BLG-127): whether the Mac
 * stays awake for the phone (`HomeView.mac.keepAwake`, `companion.keepAwake`), and (BLG-128) a phone
 * away pinging every KEEPALIVE_AWAY_MS on a relay or LAN link. 1.14: Your Mac's chats on the phone
 * (`HomeView.macChats`), started and deleted there (`assistant.newChat` / `deleteChat`). 1.15: the
 * plan a conversation is the home of (`ConvView.plan`), so its chat links back to the plan. 1.16
 * (BLG-140): the Mac writes down what you said on the phone (`companion.voice` / `voicePrepare` /
 * `transcribe`). 1.17 (BLG-150): your Mac uses your phone. The phone says what it lets the Mac do
 * (`control`), the Mac asks it to act (`req` / `reply`), and the Mac's adb reaches the phone's
 * Wireless debugging through the link (`tun_*`). 1.18 (BLG-184): the Mac's mirror of the phone as
 * live H.264 video (the `mirror` op, `vid` / `vid_end`, and the Mac's `vid_ack`). 1.19 (BLG-189,
 * BLG-190): the phone proves it's the one at a Wireless-debugging address (`proof`), and opens its
 * Developer options or About phone for the person (`open {settings}`). 1.20 (BLG-210): who's in a
 * chat and what their Claude is doing (`ChatMemberView.presence` / `claude`), what waits on whom
 * (`ChatView.waiting`), who gets a message later (`ChatView.note`), and whose a task's card is
 * (`ChatMessageView.task.who` / `secret`). Read-only fields: an older Mac just leaves them out.
 * 1.21 (BLG-237): Sentinel, your watchers (docs/sentinel.md): the `sentinels` and `sentinel:<id>`
 * topics (`SentinelsView`, `SentinelPageView`), Run Now, Pause / Turn On and a run's report
 * (`sentinel.run` / `pause` / `runs` / `runGet`), and a run waiting for your Merge as a `decision`
 * (`sentinel.decide`). 1.22 (BLG-244): numbers and dashboards (docs/sentinel.md §10): the
 * `dashboard:<id>` topic (`DashboardView`, its tiles worked out on the Mac with every compare),
 * pull to refresh (`dashboard.refresh`), a number over time (`sentinel.metricRead`), and in
 * `SentinelsView` the dashboards and the first one's first three numbers for Home. 1.23 (BLG-246):
 * Sentinel's own dashboard and its chat (docs/sentinel.md §10, §12): tiles of kind `series` (an
 * older phone's `chart` still comes as `chart`) and `output` (a step's latest export, `output`),
 * a tile's real size (`span`, `tall`; `width` stays 1 to 3 for older phones), the `draft` state,
 * and `SentinelsView.chat`, the Sentinel chat's open conversation (a `conv:sentinel-chat:<id>`
 * topic the phone writes in as any conversation). 1.24 (BLG-322): New Task from one message makes
 * several tasks: `companion.draftTask`'s `several`, a draft's `for`, `more` and `epic`, and
 * `companion.addTask` adding them all (`more` in its answer). 1.25 (BLG-345): a table tile's typed
 * columns (`table.typed`: a document, a storage object, a link, a path, with each row's whole value)
 * and its metric (`table.metric`), so a chip opens the document through the Mac (`sentinel.document`)
 * or a storage object's link signed there (`sentinel.signStorage`); a sentinel page's workflow
 * as a graph (`SentinelPageView.graph`, BLG-352). 1.26 (BLG-361): every board tile in words for
 * the phone's Home-screen widgets (the `widgets` topic, `WidgetsView`: what the Mac's desktop
 * widgets read from `~/.beluga/widgets/tiles.json`, each project's icon as its checksum).
 * 1.27 (BLG-354): a request you asked of a friend can be removed (`gateway.forget`), and a
 * needs-you item dismissed (`needs.dismiss`) without answering it, here and on the Mac.
 * 1.28 (BLG-387): a message you sent can be edited (`TurnView.edit`, `workspaces.editPrompt`):
 * the conversation rewinds to it, or goes on in a new fork from there.
 * 1.29 (BLG-386): a table's documents and storage objects as refs the phone streams (`table.typed[].docs`,
 * fetched by the Mac when asked, nothing kept), each column's `max`, `better` and `button`, and Open
 * on your Mac for one the phone doesn't show (`sentinel.documentOpen`, `sentinel.storageOpen`); what a
 * sentinel keeps (`sentinel.dataList`, BLG-392: its metrics' histories and runs' files, as refs) and
 * Open on your Mac for a run's file (`sentinel.runFileOpen`).
 * 1.30 (BLG-429): a direct message deleted (`network.messages.delete`, yours from your friend's Mac
 * too), your own edited (`network.messages.edit`, only one whose words reach the phone whole:
 * `ChatMessageView.editable`), and a direct chat cleared on the Mac (`network.clear`).
 * 1.31 (BLG-446): the agent picker in a conversation (`ConvView.agent`: runtimes as groups with their
 * models, an unavailable one with why), picked with `workbench.setModel` / `workbench.setAgent`.
 * 1.32 (BLG-459): usage per provider: each `UsageView` says its agent (`runtime`, `isDefault`),
 * a local model's `tokens` and `tokensPerSec`, and `signedIn`; the phone makes one the default
 * agent (`companion.defaultAgent`). An older Mac sends Claude Code alone, as before.
