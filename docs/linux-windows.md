# Beluga on Linux and Windows

The same Beluga runs on Linux and Windows. Some things stay Mac only.

## What's different there

| | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main shortcut key | ⌘ | Ctrl | Ctrl |
| Keys shown as | ⇧⌘F | Ctrl+Shift+F | Ctrl+Shift+F |
| Copy and paste in the terminal | ⌘C / ⌘V | Ctrl+Shift+C / V | Ctrl+Shift+C / V |
| Shell for setup and run commands | your shell | your shell | Git Bash (Git for Windows), the shell Claude Code uses too |
| A friend's screenshot | screen or one app's window | whole screen (grim, gnome-screenshot, spectacle, scrot or ImageMagick) | screen or one app's window |
| Device info | sw_vers, system_profiler, pmset | os-release, /sys | PowerShell (CIM) |
| Keeping awake for the phone | caffeinate | systemd-inhibit | SetThreadExecutionState |
| Moving to the Trash | Finder / trash | gio trash | Recycle Bin |
| Window | blur, traffic lights | solid, the desktop's own title bar | solid, the system title bar |
| Packages | .dmg | AppImage (updates itself), .deb, .rpm | installer (updates itself) |

Mac only: desktop widgets, Focus, the macOS permission steps in the welcome, the Dock badge,
sleeping only after the outbox is mailed (BLG-277), and notification sounds played from files
(on Linux and Windows the window plays them).

Shortcuts that use ⌃ on a Mac have their own keys elsewhere: Toggle Sidebar is Ctrl+B,
Approve / Decline / Always Allow are Alt+Shift+Y / N / A, Move Project is Alt+Shift+↑/↓, and
Archive has no key (it's in the menu and ⌘K).

## Where the platform code lives

- The daemon branches by `process.platform` where the systems differ, behind the ports that
  already existed (SystemPort in `src/core/gateway/device.ts`, `Awake`'s platform option), so
  tests fake Linux and Windows on any machine (`pretendSystem({ platform })`).
- `src/core/process-tree.ts` stops a command together with everything it started: a process
  group on Mac and Linux, `taskkill /T` on Windows (where `detached` would open a console).
- `src/terminal/pty.ts`: `defaultShell` and `posixSh` for each system.
- The shortcut table (`packages/mac/src/lib/shortcuts-model.ts`) reads "Cmd" as the main
  modifier, as Tauri's CmdOrCtrl does. `keyPlatform()` says which keyboard it is.
- The Tauri shell gates Mac-only code with `cfg(target_os = "macos")`.
  `tauri.linux.conf.json` and `tauri.windows.conf.json` set the window and the bundles.

## Checks and releases

- `ci.yml` runs the tests on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows. Windows doesn't block a merge until it
  has passed once.
- `desktop.yml` builds the Rust shell with clippy and runs its tests on Linux and Windows.
- `release-desktop.yml` runs when a `-mac` release is published (or by hand for a tag). It
  builds the Linux and Windows packages, uploads them to the same release, and adds
  `linux-x86_64` and `windows-x86_64` to its `latest.json`. `release-mac.mjs` keeps those
  entries when it uploads again.
- The repository needs the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (and `_PASSWORD`) secrets for update
  signatures. Windows code signing isn't set up yet, so SmartScreen warns on the first install.
