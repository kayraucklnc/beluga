# Every way in, and where the Mac app shows it

The Mac app drives Beluga's core through `src/ipc/api.ts`. This page lists every way in and where you find it in the app. `tests/parity.test.ts` fails when a command, a UI action, a menu or an API method exists without a row here.

Columns: **Core** is the API method or intent it uses; **Mac** is where you find it.

A merge itself (Merge, Merge When Ready, on GitHub or anywhere else, Merge into its base, into the main folder) draws its own line in the chat as it's seen, “Above was merged into main in PR #N”, also on the phone; one that merged while Beluga was closed shows on the next start if nothing was said there since |

| `workbench.pushPr` | ✓ the toolbar's branch state "N commits not on PR #n" › Push N Commits to PR #n: the worktree has commits its open PR doesn't, so merging would leave them out and GitHub's checks and conflicts are for an older commit (its menu: Push and Merge When Ready; the sidebar row's ↑N chip says the same; phone: the branch band's Push). Someone's fork's pull request goes to the fork's branch when its author lets maintainers edit it; otherwise the step is Open Your Own PR |

| `workbench.addressPrComments` | ✓ the PR page: Ask Claude (one thread) and Address All With Claude |

## Sending while the agent works, and images

| What | Core | Mac |
|---|---|---|
| Choose the default send action during a turn (Mac only) | Mac preference | Settings › General › Writing › **Send during a turn** · Queue (default) or Steer |
| Queue a message | `session.submit` | Return when Queue is the default, Option+Return when Steer is the default · **Queue** |
| Steer: the agent reads it at its next step without stopping, however long the step runs (a second steer joins the first; only Send now stops a step, and only a dead run is restarted) | `session.submit` with `urgent` | Return when Steer is the default, Option+Return when Queue is the default · **Steer** · agents without steering always queue |
| What waits, in run order (text, who asked) | `queueIn` (`src/ui/compose.ts`), the prompt comes with the `queued` event | the queue above the box |
| Run a waiting message now (steering, as above; a plan's Steer Now also stops a long command for it: `interrupt`) | `host.promote` | queue › Steer · plan › Steer Now |
| A steered message the agent hasn't read yet: sent, not read (its card is a note till the agent reads it: `READS_AFTER_STEP`, `STOPPING_FOR`, then `STEERED_IN` or its own turn) | `steerWaiting` (`src/shared/claude-notices.ts`), the message's `request` | your message dimmed, a clock and “Sent · the agent reads it after its current step” |
| Send it now: the agent's step stops (its interrupt, as Stop does) and the conversation goes on from your message | `host.steerNow` | **Send now** on that message · ⇧⌥↩ |
| Cancel it before the agent reads it: out of Claude Code's queue (`cancel_async_message`), the message and its card leave the chat (`TAKEN_BACK`), its words back in the box; an agent that can't take it back says so | `host.cancelSteer`, `Steer.cancel` | **Cancel** on that message (phone: long-press › Cancel, 1.43) |
| Drop a waiting message | `host.cancelQueued` | queue › ✕ |
| Edit a waiting message (back into the box) | `host.cancelQueued`, then the box | queue › ✎ |
| Change the order | `host.reorderQueued` (yours only; friends' keep their places) | queue › ↑ ↓ |
| Paste or drop an image | `attachments.add` | ⌘V / drop: a chip plus its picture above the text |
| An image in a message | `attachments.read` (yours from disk, a friend's through their share) | the picture (several in a grid); click for full size, ⌘C copies, Open shows it in Preview |

## Agent runs, per runtime

What an agent run does on each runtime (BLG-461, OpenCode BLG-686, Copilot BLG-873). A cell is **pass** (it works as on Claude), **fallback** (it works another way, or is greyed, and the UI says why: the reason is `src/shared/runtime-fallbacks.ts`, named here as `fallback:<id>`), or **n/a** (nothing of it applies on that runtime, so nothing is shown for it; a feature the runtime lacks altogether is `missing:<id>`, from the same file's `RUNTIME_MISSING`, and its control isn't offered there). `tests/parity.test.ts` fails on a blank cell, on a fallback or a missing feature the table and the code disagree about, on a fallback no screen shows, and on a capability Codex, OpenCode or Copilot lacks (`src/agent/runtime/codex/index.ts`, `src/agent/runtime/opencode/index.ts`, `src/agent/runtime/copilot/index.ts`) that no row accounts for. The local model runtime has Claude's capabilities (it is Claude Code on another endpoint) except `hasModelList`, so its column would be Claude's.

| What | Ways in | Claude | Codex | OpenCode | Copilot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Start a run in a worktree or chat, answers streamed | `session.submit`, `workspaces.startWorktree`, `workspaces.startChat` | pass | pass (`codex app-server`, a thread per place) | pass (`opencode acp`, a session per place) | pass (`copilot --acp`, a session per place; Copilot Free runs on Auto) |
| Pick the agent and model, hand a live conversation off | `/model`, `workbench.setAgent`, `workbench.setModel`, `/handoff` | pass | pass (models from `model/list`, efforts per model; a handoff starts a new thread with the conversation carried) | pass (models from `opencode models`, efforts from each model's variants; a handoff starts a new session with the conversation carried) | pass (Auto, and the models a session offers; the model is its process flag, so a change mid-run takes effect from its next run unless the session offers it; a handoff starts a new session with the conversation carried) |
| Continue a conversation later | `canResume` | pass | pass (`thread/resume`; one that can't be opened starts afresh and says so) | pass (`session/resume`; one that can't be opened starts afresh and says so) | pass (`session/load`; one that can't be opened starts afresh and says so) |
| Queue and steer while it works | `host.promote`, `canSteer` | pass | pass (`turn/steer`) | pass (`missing:steer`: the composer always queues, one prompt at a time; Steer Now on an existing message stops the turn to read it) | pass (`missing:steer`: the composer always queues, one prompt at a time; Steer Now on an existing message stops the turn to read it) |
| Stop, Send now | `host.stopRun`, `host.steerNow`, `/stop`, `canInterrupt` | pass | pass (`turn/interrupt`, then the process) | pass (`session/cancel`, then the process) | pass (`session/cancel`, then the process) |
| Approve or deny a command or an edit | `host.answerApproval`, `canGateEveryTool` | pass (every tool through the PreToolUse hook) | pass (what leaves its sandbox asks you through the same gate; inside it, the sandbox confines it) | pass (every tool call asks Beluga first: Beluga's config makes each of its permissions, every agent's, "ask", judged by the same gate as Claude's) | pass (writes, commands that change things, other folders and MCP tools ask Beluga, judged by the same gate as Claude's; reads in the folder and read-only commands run without asking) |
| .env files and secrets stay out | `env.claudeDotenv`, `hasSandbox` | pass (policy.ts per call) | pass (its permissions profile denies them: `runtime/codex/sandbox.ts`) | pass (policy.ts per call, as Claude's) | pass (`.env` files, keys and credential folders are denied reads on its command line (`--deny-tool read(…)`); a read-only command naming one isn't asked about, which is why friends' tasks and guests stay off it) |
| A friend's task on your Mac | `gateway.decide` | pass | pass (sandboxed: network off, your MCP servers off) | fallback (`fallback:friends`): handed to Claude (or Codex) when one runs here, the friend's card saying why; your plugins could answer a step before Beluga is asked | fallback (`fallback:friends`): handed to Claude (or Codex) when one runs here, the friend's card saying why; it reads and runs read-only commands without asking |
| A guest in your room prompting your agent | `invites.create` | pass | fallback (`fallback:guests`): turned away with the reason; the Invite People sheet says it beside Prompt and Edit | fallback (`fallback:guests`): turned away with the reason; the Invite People sheet says it beside Prompt and Edit | fallback (`fallback:guests`): turned away with the reason; the Invite People sheet says it beside Prompt and Edit |
| A main folder stays read-only | `continue_in_worktree` | pass | pass (a read-only sandbox, Continue in New Worktree) | pass (policy.ts per call, Continue in New Worktree) | pass (policy.ts on every write it asks about, Continue in New Worktree) |
| Plan first, then approve | `/plan`, `session.setPlanMode`, `plans.here`, `hasPlanMode` | pass | pass (a read-only first turn answering with a plan, then the same approval card) | pass (its own plan agent, which edits nothing, then the same approval card) | pass (its own Plan mode, edits turned down too, then the same approval card) |
| Images in a message | `attachments.add`, `promptImages` | pass | pass | pass | pass |
| Beluga's tools (room, board, plans, views, Mac, phone, sentinels) | `toolMounts` | pass (in process) | pass (stdio, scoped by a token) | pass (stdio, scoped by a token) | pass (http on 127.0.0.1, scoped by a token: Copilot takes no stdio servers from a client) |
| Steps on the agent card | `agent.steps`, `agent.step` | pass | pass (commands, edits, MCP calls mapped to the same steps) | pass (its read, edit, bash, grep, MCP calls mapped to the same steps) | pass (its read, edit, execute, search, fetch and MCP calls mapped to the same steps by their kind) |
| Usage and plan limits | `/usage`, `hasUsage` | pass | pass (its plan windows, filed under Codex) | pass (tokens and cost per turn; no plan windows: it runs on your providers or its free models) | pass (tokens per turn and the context meter; no plan windows: Copilot doesn't say what's left of your plan) |
| Compact the conversation | `/compact`, `session.compact`, `workspaces.compact`, `hasCompaction` | pass | fallback (`fallback:compact`): Compact greyed in the toolbar with the reason; /compact and Compact now say it; auto-compact leaves Codex to compact itself | pass (its own `/compact`, its summary kept out of the chat) | pass (its own `/compact`, its summary kept out of the chat) |
| Fork a worktree | `/fork`, `workspaces.fork`, `canFork` | pass | fallback (`fallback:fork`): the toolbar's Fork says it in its hint, and the fork's first run says it as it starts | pass (`session/fork`) | fallback (`fallback:fork`): the toolbar's Fork says it in its hint, and the fork's first run says it as it starts |
| Edit a sent message (Rewind Here, New Fork) | `workspaces.editPrompt` | pass | fallback (`fallback:rewind`): the files go back; the line under the edit says the conversation starts afresh | fallback (`fallback:rewind`): the files go back; the line under the edit says the conversation starts afresh | fallback (`fallback:rewind`): the files go back; the line under the edit says the conversation starts afresh |
| Skills and custom commands | `claudeCode.skills`, `skills` | pass (native) | fallback (`fallback:skills`): translated; each one in the / list says what isn't on Codex | pass (it loads your Claude Code skills itself; custom commands are expanded for it, Claude Code's own built-ins go in as text with a note) | pass (it loads your Claude Code skills and commands itself; others are expanded for it, Claude Code's own built-ins go in as text with a note) |
| MCP servers of your own | `claudeCode.mcpServers`, `claudeCode.mcpSignIn`, `claudeCode.mcpSetEnabled` | pass | pass (its own from `~/.codex/config.toml` through `mcpServerStatus/list`, signed in with `mcpServer/oauth/login`, turned on and off with `config/value/write`; a friend's task gets them switched off) | n/a: the ones in your OpenCode config run in its runs, as in OpenCode; Settings lists Claude Code's and Codex's | n/a: the ones in your Copilot config (and its GitHub server) run in its runs, as in Copilot; Settings lists Claude Code's and Codex's |
| Questions the agent asks you mid-run | `questions.answer`, `canAskUser` | pass | n/a: Codex asks in its answer, and you reply in the box | n/a: its question tool is off (it can't reach you over ACP), so it asks in its answer and you reply in the box | n/a: its question form is off (`--no-ask-user`: it can't reach you over ACP), so it asks in its answer and you reply in the box |
| Sub-agents and background agents | `claudeCode.findAgent`, `hasSubagents`, `hasBackgroundAgents` | pass | pass (its multi_agent on for your own runs, off for friends' and side calls: each sub-agent a row on the card with its name, prompt, steps and report, on the phone's sub-agent sheet too; the run stays open while ones it didn't wait for still work, up to the same 3 hours; Stop interrupts each one's turn. No Watch page or sidebar row: Codex keeps no Claude Code transcript for them) | pass (its task tool's sub-agents, each a row on the card; no background agents: a run ends when it answers) | n/a: no sub-agent rows; a run ends when it answers |
| Claude Code sessions outside Beluga | `claudeCode.steps` | pass | n/a: Claude Code's own transcripts | n/a: Claude Code's own transcripts | n/a: Claude Code's own transcripts |
| The process watched and killed for sure | `hasProcess` | pass | pass | pass | pass |
| Side calls (naming a worktree, drafting a task, chat answers) | `complete` | pass | pass (`codexComplete`) | pass (`openCodeComplete`: one prompt as an agent of Beluga's, its session dropped after) | pass (`copilotComplete`: one prompt without your instruction files, its session dropped after; each uses one of your Copilot requests) |
| A side question (/btw) | `/btw`, `session.btw` | pass | n/a (`missing:btw`): Codex can't fork its thread, so /btw isn't offered in its conversations | pass (a fork of its session with no tools, dropped after) | n/a (`missing:btw`): Copilot can't branch its session, so /btw isn't offered in its conversations |
| The agent's own terminal | `agentTerm.open` | pass | n/a (`missing:terminal`): no Terminal view; its conversations stay in the chat | n/a (`missing:terminal`): no Terminal view; its conversations stay in the chat | n/a (`missing:terminal`): no Terminal view; its conversations stay in the chat |

## Runtime conformance (BLG-462)

The same scenarios run on every runtime (`tests/runtime-conformance.ts`, `npx vitest run tests/runtime-conformance.test.ts`): the in-memory reference, Claude's real runner over a scripted Agent SDK `query` (`tests/fake-claude.ts`), Codex's real runner over a scripted `codex app-server` speaking the payloads codex-cli sends (`src/agent/runtime/codex/scripted.ts`), OpenCode's over a scripted `opencode acp` speaking the payloads OpenCode 1.19 sends (`src/agent/runtime/opencode/scripted.ts`), and Copilot's over a scripted `copilot --acp` speaking the payloads Copilot CLI 1.0.107 sends (`src/agent/runtime/copilot/scripted.ts`). Where runtimes may differ, a capability flag says so and the scenario checks it both ways; mutants of the reference runtime prove a difference no flag covers fails the suite. **Live** runs against a signed-in Claude Code or Codex are waived (BLG-475: no Codex sign-in on the build Mac). OpenCode's free models need no account, so its live column is `scripts/live-opencode.ts` run against OpenCode 1.19.5 (steering and friends' tasks are refused before OpenCode is reached, so they're waived). Copilot Free needs only a GitHub account, so its live column is `scripts/live-copilot.ts` run against Copilot CLI 1.0.107 on Auto (steering and friends' tasks are refused before Copilot is reached, so they're waived).

| A workspace's screen: the conversation always in the center; a right panel (⌥⌘0, resizable, its tab remembered per workspace; in two panes split where you drag it: what the agent made on top (Changes, Files, Scratch, Info) and what runs below (Terminal, Background; it folds to its tabs); drag a tab to the other pane or right-click › Move to Bottom / Top, Reset Panel Layout; tabs always named; History is Changes' second view; a dot on Scratch when the agent saves something new) with Changes (files with +/−, the diff inline or the file as itself; a line's + comments on it, Shift for a range, and the comment waits above the message box as a card (where, the line, what you said; × takes it away), its lines marked, until Send takes it after your words; the full-size diff says how many wait, with Go to Chat (`views/DiffComment.tsx`, `chat/CommentCards.tsx`) — Markdown formatted, pictures and PDFs always as themselves — Show in Files, Commit / PR / Review), Files (a tree you filter by name, a preview with PDFs drawn page by page, Show Changes on a changed file), Terminal (the workspace's shells, setup and run) and Info (the inspector); a calm toolbar (what the workspace needs next, Run, ⋯ in sections: git steps, the conversation, the folder, putting it away; then Search, the bell, the panel); ⌘J types in the terminal, and puts it away when you're already typing there; the agent's steps fold away once it answers (Show Steps on the answer, Settings › Chat to keep them); ⌘J's terminal in that panel or a drawer under the chat; a diff, file or the terminal in full for a while (⌘↩, Esc back) | Mac (`layout/RightPanel.tsx`, `layout/panel/*`, `lib/panel.ts`) |
| Dock badge, clicking a desktop notification to go where it's about | Mac |
| Marking one notification unread again | Mac (hover a notification) |
| First-run welcome: an eight-part animated tour (parallel worktrees, live agents, the table weave: the agent picks Postgres, connects and answers with a real, sortable table view, friends, Sentinel: a sentence becomes a sentinel (its trigger, steps and access, turned on, run step by step, its report) for five real ones you can pick, then Sentinel at work: its page's films with the sentence that sets each up, earnings, archive), then the look, the message box’s fire (Arcade, Ghost or None, tried in a live box) and a few shared settings; the macOS permissions one a step, each optional (Not Now, Skip Permissions) with why in a sentence, whether Beluga has it, and a button to its System Settings pane: Screen Recording, Accessibility, Full Disk Access, Automation (`privacy_access`, `privacy_request` in `src-tauri/src/privacy.rs`); notifications (allowed or not); the Android phone app with Pair a Phone… (`companion.pair.start`) and where to get it; once per Mac, never after an update; Help › Welcome to Beluga shows it again | Mac (`onboarding/*`, `lib/privacy.ts`) |

| Terminal look (font, size, line height, cursor style and blink, scrollback) | Mac (`lib/prefs.ts`, Settings › Terminal) |
| Environment variable editor (masked values, a copy button, paste KEY=value lines, search past ten, Undo after removing; a project's main folder .env loads by default and shows beside its own variables, with yours greyed below, each marked where it comes from, an edit to one overriding it and Use … undoing that, Keep a Copy in Beluga; names .env.example asks for that nothing sets shown empty as needed; a worktree's own variables over everything else) | Mac (Settings › Environment: yours and a list of projects; a project's Settings sheet with General, Environment and Worktrees tabs from the gear on its page, ••• › Project Settings… and Environment…, ⌘K › Project Settings… and its page's Environment pill and section; a worktree's ••• › Environment…: `dialogs/EnvEditor.tsx`, `dialogs/EnvironmentSheet.tsx`, `dialogs/native/ProjectSettingsSheet.tsx`). The phone gets none of it: settings stay the Mac's |
| A worktree changed a .env the main folder doesn't have: an env bar (its keys as +added ~changed −removed tags) with Copy to Main Folder and Keep Here, in the project page's Environment section and in the worktree; untouched copies follow the main folder's .env on their own; keys a worktree adds or removes reach its own .env.example (BLG-925) | Mac (`views/project/EnvAsks.tsx`, `views/project/EnvSection.tsx`) |
| Confirmations as alerts (archive/delete with “Commit & Archive”, an env-changes table, and boxes to carry a worktree's own variables to the project, copy its .env changes, and also remove keys it took out; clear, agent worktrees, hide project, leave a shared workspace), each with Cancel | Mac (`dialogs/native/*Alert.tsx`, `components/Alert.tsx`) |
| Inviting, people and sharing as sheets and cards: the Invite People sheet (Invite to popup, Watch / Prompt / Edit, Copy Invite Link with “Copied”, people waiting, active links with Copy and Revoke), a person's card beside their row (trust as a segmented control, Message / Ask Your Agent / Run / Follow / Files, usage meters, Remove with an alert), your account card (rename in place, who may use your agent), a right-click Trust ▸ submenu, the Share sheet for a workspace (an access popup per person), Share a Folder (Open panel, your projects, only some people, the agent may edit, Stop Sharing), the room's card from the sidebar's status | Mac (`dialogs/native/InviteSheet.tsx`, `PersonPopover.tsx`, `PersonCards.tsx`, `PersonMenu.tsx`, `WorkspaceShare.tsx`, `ShareFolderSheet.tsx`, `SharedSheet.tsx`, `RoomPopover.tsx`) |

| Run a command on a friend's computer from a sheet with a command field | Mac (`dialogs/native/PeerSheets.tsx`) |
| Search over a workspace shared with you (names and contents) above its Files, instead of a read-only shell tab | Mac (`views/SharedSearch.tsx`) |
| A shared workspace's earlier conversation drawn as people's messages | Mac (`lib/said.ts`, from each line's `said`) |
| Clicking an invite link (`beluga://<key>…#secret`) opens the Join sheet | Mac (`lib/native.ts` `inviteOf`) |
| Forms instead of typing in the message box: fork name, project Setup/Run (with where each comes from, and “Save to beluga.json”: `workbench.setScript(…, team)`), PR with extra instructions, new template with Plan first (`workbench.saveTemplate(…, plan)`), hand off, a worktree or a command on a friend's computer, the model, the welcome choice | Mac (`dialogs/native/`, `lib/native-routes.ts`) |
| Colours in the sidebar: right-click a project, chat or worktree › Color ▸ (the board's label colours, or None; a chat or worktree also has Same as Project): a soft stripe at the row's edge and its icon in the colour, in the project list, Chats, Unread and the categories; a project's chats and worktrees take its colour unless they have their own; a project's letter tile takes it too. Nothing is coloured until you pick one; kept on this Mac | Mac (`lib/row-colors.ts`, `layout/row-color-view.tsx`) |
| Groups in the sidebar: Move to Group ▸ submenu, a new group named in place, rename, ungroup (`workspaces.renameGroup`, `workspaces.ungroup`), drag a project onto a group or out of it | Mac (`layout/ProjectGroups.tsx`) |
| Arranging the sidebar Finder-style: drag projects to reorder them (an insertion line, the list scrolls near its edges, Esc puts it back), drop one on a group (the folder lights up; a folded one springs open) or between a group's projects, pull it out to the top level, drag groups among the projects; Move Up / Move Down (⌃⌘↑/↓) in a row's menu; empty groups you make stay until you delete them (`workspaces.arrange`, `workspaces.newGroup`; the order lives in projects.json's `order` and each group's list, see `src/workspaces/arrange.ts`). Project rows don't fold (their worktrees and chats always show, never the main checkout; clicking one opens the project); groups fold, with a count | Mac (`layout/ProjectTree.tsx`, `layout/arrange-drag.ts`, `layout/project-layout.ts`) |
| Hiding a project with Undo (“Hidden api — Undo”, ⌘Z) instead of an alert; Hidden Projects folded at the bottom of the sidebar, in Settings › Workspaces and in the Add Projects sheet, each with Show (`workspaces.showProject`; it comes back in its place and group) | Mac (`layout/ProjectTree.tsx`, `lib/undo-toast.tsx`) |
| “Connect GitHub” with copyable commands and Check Again (`workbench.refreshPrs(id, true)` looks for gh again) | Mac (PR sheet) |
| Stop your agent in one conversation (`host.stopRun`): your queued messages there come back into the box, other people's requests keep their places and run next, other conversations carry on | Mac (■ Stop beside the send control, ⌘., Conversation › Stop the Agent, Stop on a running answer) |
| Workspace and Conversation menus in the menu bar (Commit… ⇧⌘C, Pull Request… ⇧⌘P, Merge… ⇧⌘M, Run ⌘R, Ask Your Agent to Review… ⇧⌘R, Archive… ⌃⌘A, Stop ⌘., Plan First ⌥⌘P, Find ⌘F / ⌘G / ⇧⌘G, Clear ⇧⌘K, Previous/Next Workspace ⌥⌘↑/↓), greyed out when they can't run (`lib/commands.ts`, `set_menu_state`); what starts the agent or changes git (Review, Commit, Merge, Solve Conflict, Compact, Fix Checks) says what it will do and waits for Start, from every way in (a popover under its toolbar button, else an alert; `lib/work-confirm.ts`) | Mac |
| A search field at the top of the sidebar (⌥⌘F): chats by name, branch, PR or project at once, then messages through `workbench.search`; arrows and Enter, Esc clears, See All in Search opens the Search page | Mac (`layout/SidebarSearch.tsx`) |
| A calm sidebar: Overview, Work (Tasks, Issues and Plans in one row, a Tasks · Issues · Plans switch over each list, running plans under it) and Group chat at the top, always; Activity only while it's live and Requests only while one is unanswered (answered ones are tucked behind Show answered on the Requests page); Files (folders friends and the room share, grouped by person) as a row of its own, and projects friends share in Projects (there is no Shared with me any more); Search in the toolbar (⇧⌘F); Usage as an icon above the sidebar (amber when most of the week is used); the terminal in the right panel (⌘J). The places in order (Overview, Tasks, Chat, Search, Usage, Terminal, Files) for ⌘1…7, ⌃Tab, the Go menu and the palette (`lib/go.ts`) | Mac |
| The toolbar's main button chosen from the workspace's state (Commit / Merge / PR #n / Fix Checks / Solve Conflict / Restore / Run), the rest as icons and a ⋯ menu with shortcuts (`layout/toolbar-actions.ts`) | Mac |
| Select chats with Shift-click in visible sidebar order, across Chats and project chats. Selected rows that touch read as one box, with a dashed line between rows, and a count shows under the lists; both ease in and out. Their context menu archives or deletes the full selection after one confirmation with the count. A failed chat does not stop the batch, and one message reports the whole batch. The alert names failed chats, and they stay selected. While a batch runs, its chats stay selected. Escape or a plain click clears the selection, and the next Shift-click still starts from the last clicked chat. Folded projects and groups stay outside the selection. | Mac (`layout/chat-selection.ts`, `layout/chat-selection-view.tsx`, `layout/ProjectTree.tsx`, `layout/workspace-row.tsx`) |
| Find in a conversation (⌘F) | Mac (`chat/FindBar.tsx`) |
| Your own keyboard shortcuts (BLG-289): Settings › Keyboard (Help › Keys and Commands, ⌘/, ⌘K › Keyboard Shortcuts…) lists every shortcut by section; click a key and press the new one, + for another key, × to take one away, ↺ back to its own, Reset All with Undo; a key something else has offers Swap / Use Here / Cancel (↩ / esc), what macOS keeps (⌘Q, ⌘C…) and keys that would type are refused with why; find a shortcut by name or by pressing its keys (and see a key is free). The window, the pages' own keys, the message box, requests, the sidebar, the talk shortcut, the menu bar's accelerators (`set_menu_keys`, off while recording), tooltips and the palette all follow; kept on this Mac (`prefs.shortcuts`) | Mac (`lib/shortcuts-model.ts`, `lib/shortcuts.ts`, `dialogs/KeyboardSettings.tsx`) |
| Right-click menus: messages (Copy, Copy as Markdown, Quote in Reply, Ask Your Agent About This, Open Image), code blocks, files (Open, Show in Finder, Copy Path, Mention in Chat, Save a Copy…), a path named in chat (Open, Show in Finder, Copy Path), changed files and commits in Diff, search results, Usage rows, notifications | Mac |
| Save a shared file where you choose (`files.download` with `to`, the Save panel) | Mac |
| A new worktree's form: Based on (`workspaces.branches`), Name, Create Worktree (`workspaces.startWorktree` with `base` / `name`) | Mac |
| No standing main conversation per project (BLG-70): a project's conversations are the chats and worktrees you start; the main checkout is the project's home (Update main, Fetch, Merge into main, its terminal), not a conversation. Nothing lists or opens it as one (sidebar, Overview, ⌘K, @mentions, the project menu, notifications, the phone's Work and Open on your Mac go to its home or the chat it became), and the agent never runs in it on its own. Once, at startup, a main conversation from before becomes an ordinary chat in its project with its history, agent session, model and usage, named after its first message (`workspaces/main-migration.ts`; an empty one goes) | both (core: `workspaces/main-migration.ts`, `client/screen.ts` `viewFor`, `core/workspace-controller.ts`; Mac: `lib/project-home.ts` `newChatProject`) |
| Never change main: every agent run in a project's main folder (the main checkout, or a chat there) is questions only. Edits, writes and shell commands that aren't clearly read-only are denied (`agent/policy.ts` `askOnly`, `agent/read-only.ts`), the agent is told so, and a change request makes it call `continue_in_worktree`: a new worktree from the latest origin, named after the task, and the chat itself becomes that worktree (same conversation and agent session, now in the worktree's folder), and the work goes on there (your own requests move right away; someone else's ask you first) | both (core) |
| A project's home (`project` view): icon, name, main's branch and how it compares with origin, counts (active / ready to merge / archived, earnings), “What do you want to do in …?” with New Worktree (Based on, Name) or Just Ask, then its worktrees, questions and recently archived (Show All in Overview), and last (with Stripe or RevenueCat connected) its Earnings as one folded row: earned in the last 7 / 30 / 90 days, payments and paying customers (Stripe's), each against the span before, and the last payment; unfolded (both kept), the range, a bar per day, each source's part of it (with both), RevenueCat's MRR, active subscriptions, active trials, new customers and "You keep" with Open RevenueCat, and Stripe's latest payments (All / Refunds / Failed, New for what arrived while shown, Show All, Open Stripe; Earnings… for the sheet). Clicking a project opens it | Mac (`views/ProjectHome.tsx`, `lib/project-home.ts`) |
| Keeping main current and seeing history: the project home is about the default branch (main or master, “3 behind origin/main”, and “The main folder is on feat/…” with Switch to main), Update main and Fetch with when it last fetched, a quiet fetch of every project every ~15 min (Settings › Workspaces › Fetch in the background makes it slower, or turns it and the fetch on opening a project off; never a password prompt: GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0), uncommitted changes in the way (stash and put back, or move to a worktree), anything else to the agent in a run whose only permission beyond reading is syncing git (`agent/sync-main.ts`; never push, never discard), the GitHub row, and History (a commit graph with lanes and merges, authors as initials, refs as pills, filters, a commit's diffs; `views/history/*`) | Mac (`views/project/MainSyncBar.tsx`, `views/project/GitHubRow.tsx`, `views/history/*`, `layout/panel/HistoryTab.tsx`; core: `core/main-sync.ts`, `workspaces/sync.ts`, `workspaces/history.ts`, `workspaces/github.ts`) |
| A questions-only chat: “Questions only — your agent won’t change anything in main.” above the box, Continue in New Worktree… as the toolbar's main button, “Ask about <project>…” in the box | Mac (`chat/AskBanner.tsx`, `dialogs/native/ContinueSheet.tsx`) |
| Sub-agents: under the conversation that started them in the sidebar (a robot, running first, “N more”), their own worktrees as the agent (never as your worktrees; old ones no conversation here started aren’t listed, Clean Up Worktrees… has them), the sub-agent page (who started it, type, model, effort, time, steps, context; its live transcript with thinking and tools; its worktree's Changes, Files and Scratch beside it; Send to Main Agent to steer it through its lead), Watch on a sub-agent in the chat | Mac (`src/layout/SubAgents.tsx`, `src/claude-code/AgentMonitor.tsx`) |
| Chats with friends: tabs above the conversation (All Friends first; open, close, + for a new channel), files shared Mac to Mac (cards, pictures, progress, Open / Show in Finder / Save As), agents called in with the Ask Your Agent menu (answers marked “bob’s agent”, “… is answering”), Settings › People & access › Who can ask your agent in chats; a task between two people's agents as a live card in their DM or channel (BLG-208), your own agent acting there with its tools, its "Ask Alice's agent?" cards, approvals and questions above the message box, and friends' requests approved on their card (BLG-207) | Mac (`src/network/ChatTabs.tsx`, `ChatFiles.tsx`, `NetComposer.tsx`, `ConversationView.tsx`) |
| Friends, direct messages, groups and your status (the Beluga network): sidebar Friends and Groups with presence and unread, the Add a Friend sheet (code, link, QR; `beluga://add` / `beluga://join` links), conversations (`conversation` view), New Group / Add People sheets, group info (members, admins, invite link, join requests, rename, leave), the status menu in the sidebar and the menu bar, Away when idle, Settings › People & access switch | Mac (`src/network/*`) |
| Empty states with one-click starters (New Worktree, New Chat, Add Projects…, first tasks for the agent) | Mac |
| The palette's commands as named actions (“Create Pull Request…”, “Fork This Workspace…”), never `/cmd <arg>` | Mac (`dialogs/palette-commands.ts`) |
| The Beluga network: friends added once by a one-time link or a short code, direct messages that wait for offline friends, groups that live on their members' Macs (no host, end-to-end encrypted, admins add and remove people, join by link), and your status (online, away, do not disturb, appear offline) — the `network.*` API and the shared state's `network` | Mac (the daemon runs it when `network: true` is in settings or `BELUGA_NETWORK=1`; `src/net/mesh/`, `src/core/network.ts`) |
| Earnings from Stripe and RevenueCat per project, added into one total (the Earnings… sheet connects either; RevenueCat apps billed through a connected Stripe account are left to Stripe so nothing counts twice; RevenueCat's own keys live in ~/.beluga/revenuecat.json, 0600, and its `revenuecat` state carries the apps, totals, proceeds and subscription figures, never the key). Stripe's part: a key per project (kept in ~/.beluga/stripe.json, 0600; screens only get `earnings`: connected, the account's name, all-time totals per currency, what it did lately (`activity`: the last 180 days' earnings per day, distinct paying customers per 7 / 30 / 90 days and the span before, the latest 25 payments with a first name and initial or a masked email, never more), when they were counted, what went wrong), counted in the background (a quick look for new payments every 10 minutes, the last months read again when something came in or once a day, a full recount weekly), shown as a pill beside each project in the sidebar (a new Stripe payment: it hops, and pixel-art confetti bursts from it; a rise in RevenueCat's total: it hops without confetti; none with reduced motion), as the Earnings section of the project's home, and as a card in the Overview and the Usage view, every total in one currency (`prefs.earningsCurrency`, "Show earnings in" in Settings › General and the Stripe sheet; unset: the one most was earned in), other currencies converted at the ECB's daily rates (`src/core/fx-rates.ts`, `fx` in the shared state, fetched alongside the daily Stripe count) — the `stripe.*` and `revenuecat.*` APIs and the shared state's `earnings` and `revenuecat` | Mac (`src/core/stripe-earnings.ts` and `stripe-activity.ts`, `src/core/revenuecat-earnings.ts` and `earnings-combined.ts`, the daemon runs them; `components/EarningsPill.tsx`, `components/PixelBurst.tsx` and `pixel-burst-model.ts`, `views/project/EarningsSection.tsx`, `dialogs/EarningsSheet.tsx`, `lib/earnings.ts`) |
| Supporting Beluga: worktrees Beluga made that end up merged (Merge into main, a pull request merged on GitHub, or git finding the branch's own commits in the default branch: archived worktrees too, and a deleted one just before its branch goes) count once per branch, kept in ~/.beluga/support.json; the third merge brings the Star sheet, once ("You shipped your 3rd PR with Beluga"): a paper-cut ocean of blue layers with the whale rising out of it (still with reduced motion), the maker as a GitHub chip, a GitHub-style Star button with the count, Share feedback (a new GitHub discussion), and the number yours would be (the daemon asks GitHub's public API once a day, nothing about you sent; no number when it can't), Star Beluga on GitHub or Maybe Later. Beluga never asks for money. Settings › About › Support Beluga (Star on GitHub) and the palette's Star Beluga on GitHub… have it any time ("Enjoying Beluga?") — the `support.*` API and the shared state's `support`. The phone never asks | Mac (`src/core/merge-counter.ts`, `src/core/support-store.ts`, `src/core/github-stars.ts`, the daemon runs it; `dialogs/SupportSheets.tsx`, `dialogs/StarScene.tsx`, `lib/support.ts`) |
| Usage statistics (BLG-922): only Beluga's own releases can send them (`telemetry-release.json` beside the daemon, written by `scripts/build-sidecar.mjs` from `BELUGA_TELEMETRY_URL` and `BELUGA_TELEMETRY_KEY`, a Ratel ingest-only key); a build from source never asks and never sends. Off sends nothing; Limited sends each turn of every runtime as spans (model, tokens, cost, tools by name, how it ended), features used (API method names, counted per minute), Claude Code's own telemetry without who you are, and this computer's kind; On adds the words you typed (never what Beluga adds to the prompt) and the agent's answers on your own turns, masked on this computer first (your variables' and the projects' .env values, keys by their shape, emails, home folders). Never files, commands, other people's messages, or error messages. New installs choose at the end of the onboarding (Limited picked); updated ones get one ask; Settings › General › Usage statistics and the phone's Settings change it (docs/telemetry.md) | Mac (`src/telemetry/`, `src/core/telemetry-store.ts`, the daemon runs it; `onboarding/ShareStep.tsx`, `dialogs/TelemetrySheets.tsx`, `dialogs/TelemetrySettings.tsx`), phone (Settings) |
| Your stats (Usage tab): the daemon counts prompts (where you typed them), characters, your agent's run time for you, worktrees and chats made and archived, tokens per day, project and agent, and how far each plan window (5-hour session, week) got before it reset, as they happen (pastes and dictation time come from the Mac's composer, lengths only), kept in ~/.beluga/stats.json; the first start backfills from workspace records and chat histories, and pull requests (opened, merged, lines) come from `gh pr list` for Beluga's branches every few hours; the Usage tab asks for them with `stats.get` while it's open. The phone keeps its plan meters | Mac (`src/core/stats/`, `src/shared/stats.ts`, `src/shared/stats-trend.ts`; `views/usage/StatsSection.tsx`, `views/usage/SessionsCard.tsx`, `views/usage/TrendChart.tsx`, `views/usage/stats-model.ts`) |
| Claude Code running outside Beluga, live and read-only: sessions you run through Conductor or a terminal, and their sub-agents (description, type, running / finished / failed / stopped / idle, the current step, steps, context), found by watching the transcripts Claude Code writes in ~/.claude/projects (never written to; tailed from the end, at most the last 200 steps per agent kept), in Activity (every live session by project, “6 agents running”), a strip above a workspace's chat and the Inspector's Claude Code panel (the session's folder is the workspace's, Conductor worktrees included), and a read-only transcript per session or agent; a background agent finishing notifies (`background`) — the `claudeCode.steps` API and the shared state's `claudeCode` (screens on this computer only, never sent to the room) | Mac (`src/core/claude-code/`, the daemon runs it; `src/claude-code/*` in the app) |
| A chat's link (`beluga://chat/<owner>/<channel>`): Copy Chat Link on the right-click menu of worktree, project-chat, plan and Your Mac rows and of Your Mac's tabs; opening one from anywhere, or from a message, shows that chat; a chat on another computer or a removed one says so and stays where you are. The phone opens links too (`app/chat-link.tsx`) and has no Copy Link: it has no row menus | Mac (`lib/chat-links.ts`, `lib/native.ts`, `chat/Markdown.tsx`) · phone (`app/+native-intent.tsx`, `app/chat-link.tsx`) |
| The Worktrees page: every worktree in your projects (Beluga's, sub-agents', made outside Beluga) with who made it (a sub-agent's conversation, or that it's gone), whether its work is done, its size and what can be cleared; tick some, then Free Up Space (they stay) or Archive (everything of yours kept); the sidebar's Worktrees row, a project's Manage Worktrees… | Mac (`src/views/worktrees/`) |
| Tasks between agents (the gateway): your agent finds who can help (`who_can`), asks their agent (`ask_person`) or runs one command on their Mac (`run_on`), waits (`wait_for`) or ends its turn and continues when the answer comes back; you're asked first for people you don't trust (a card in the conversation), their side approves with today's approval cards unless they trust you; results go only to the requester, as data. Task cards in conversations, the Requests view (Sent / Received) — the `gateway.*` API and the shared state's `gateway` | Mac (`src/core/gateway/`, the daemon runs it; `src/gateway/*` in the app) |
| Tasks (the board): a Tasks place in the sidebar with My Tasks, Active, Backlog and All, by project; a list grouped by status, a board you drag cards across, and a graph of what waits on what (the graph engine); filtered by who or by the worktree doing or carrying them (a worktree's Info tab lists its tasks and opens the board filtered to it); a task's page (its title, properties, a brief in sections that the agent and you keep true with every version kept, sub-tasks, blockers, its worktree and pull request, proof, activity and comments); a task opens with every new worktree and follows its pull request (In Review when it opens, Done when it merges); Start on a task (or Start Worktree Only), Open Worktree when one already does or carries it; your agent's runs in a task's worktree get its brief and the task tools (`mcp__beluga_board__*`) — the `board.*` API and the shared state's `board` | Mac (`src/core/board/`, the daemon runs it; `src/tasks/*` in the app) |
| GitHub issues: a project's issues in Beluga (the Issues place in the sidebar, an issue's page, the latest four on a project's home), read through gh with your own sign-in. One click hands one to the agent, always through a task, so it shows on the board and its pull request moves it along: Investigate (a worktree where the agent finds out why and reproduces it, its findings in the task's brief and on the issue's page, stopping before any fix), Fix It (there, or in a new worktree, with a pull request that says "Fixes #n"), Make a Task (written by the agent from the issue, or after a quick read-only look at the code). A task made from an issue links back to it (its page, its row, the strip above its conversation) and the agent's runs on it know the issue — the `issues.*` API and `Issue.github` | Mac (`src/core/issues/`, the daemon runs it; `src/issues/*` in the app); the phone sees the tasks, not the issues yet (BLG-170) |
| Team boards (BLG-220): friends with the same GitHub repository as a project on their own Macs find each other by a fingerprint keyed for the two of them (a friend who lacks the repository learns nothing), team up when both say yes, and keep one board for it; the team badge (teammates' avatars) on the project's row, Leave Team in its ••• — the `team.*` API and the shared state's `team` | Mac (`src/core/team/`, the daemon runs it with the board; `src/team/*` in the app); phone: the offer as a card |
| Sentinel (docs/sentinel.md, BLG-236): watchers that run on a schedule, by hand or after another sentinel, do a few steps in order (Ask Your Agent in the project, a worktree or Your Mac; Run a script with your environment; Notify me; Call a service with presets; Open a pull request; Merge if acceptable — checks, a review, your Merge; Message a chat; Ask a friend's agent; Run another sentinel) and leave a report; your agent sets one up or changes it (`sentinel.ask`); one run per sentinel at a time, at most Run at Once agent steps together, a time limit, runs per day, pausing after failures in a row; missed slots caught up once or skipped; ~/.beluga/sentinel.json and each run's folder in ~/.beluga/sentinel/runs — the `sentinel.*` API, the agent's `mcp__beluga_sentinel__*` tools (`sentinel_stop` inside a run, `sentinel_list`, `sentinel_get`, `sentinel_create`, `sentinel_update`, `sentinel_run`, `sentinel_test`, `sentinel_try_source`, `sentinel_pause`, `sentinel_remove`, `sentinel_runs`, `sentinel_delete_runs`) and the shared state's `sentinel` | Mac (`src/core/sentinel/`, the daemon runs it; the window's Sentinel section: the sidebar's Sentinel row, the list, a sentinel's page, a run's page, New Sentinel with its eleven recipes, ⌘K › Go to Sentinel and New Sentinel…, Go › Sentinel); the phone runs, pauses and reads runs (`sentinel.run`, `pause`, `runs`, `runGet`, `decide`) |
| The Sentinel chat (docs/sentinel.md §12, BLG-246): one conversation with your own agent for the whole of Sentinel (several kept, one open), its system prompt telling how Sentinel works with the sentinels, dashboards and numbers as material, the `beluga_sentinel` and `beluga_dashboard` tools; creating, changing and running without asking, deleting a sentinel or a dashboard always asking your approval; quiet (not in the sidebar's chats, Unread or notifications); ~/.beluga/sentinel/chat — the `sentinel.chat*` API, the `sentinel-chat:<id>` channels, the shared state's `sentinel.chats` | Mac (Sentinel › Chat: the app's own chat with its bar, New Chat, ⋯ › Clear and Delete Chat…; ⌘K › Go to Sentinel Chat); the phone's Sentinel screen › Chat opens it as a conversation it writes and answers in (`SentinelsView.chat`, `companion.ask`) |
| Numbers and dashboards (docs/sentinel.md §10, BLG-244, reworked in BLG-246): a Keep the numbers step (`measure`: from the step before, a view source, or the agent's `sentinel_measure`) keeps named numbers, series (a whole array), rows or a step's output per run in ~/.beluga/sentinel/metrics/<sentinel>/<name>.jsonl (two years or 20 000 points); the state carries each metric's last 90 points and last rows; dashboards in ~/.beluga/dashboards.json — the `dashboard.*` API and `sentinel.metricRead`, the agent's `mcp__beluga_dashboard__*` tools (`sentinel_measure` inside a run, `dashboard_list`, `dashboard_create`, `dashboard_update`, `dashboard_remove` (asks you), `dashboard_add_tile`, `dashboard_update_tile`, `dashboard_move_tile`, `dashboard_remove_tile`, `metric_list`, `metric_read`), six number recipes | Mac (a sentinel's page › Numbers above History; Sentinel's Dashboard tab (Sentinels · Dashboard · Chat at the top of the Sentinel page; ⌘K › Go to Dashboard and Go › Dashboard land there): tile kinds number, series, table, output, text and divider, sized and retitled from a tile's ⋯, its tabs, compare, Refresh, Add a Tile by description (a draft sentinel when nothing fetches it yet) or picked, drag; New Sentinel › Recipe › Keep the numbers); the phone's `dashboard:<id>` screen with compare chips and pull to refresh, Home's row of the first dashboard's first three numbers (`dashboard.refresh`, `sentinel.metricRead`) |
| Agent threads (`prefs.agentThreads`, off by default): an agent starts child chats on any installed harness and follows them with `mcp__beluga_threads__*`; no new screen, children show as normal chats | Mac (`src/core/threads/`, the daemon runs it) |
| Plans: milestones with pass criteria and parallel tasks, drafted by the agent in a conversation and kept off the board until approved; a live plan graph and outline; Step by Step · Check-ins · Autopilot run by a scheduler that starts worktrees and asks the agent to check each milestone; the composer's Plan with Tasks — the `plans.*` API, the agent's `mcp__beluga_plan__*` tools and the shared state's `plans` | Mac (`src/core/plans/`, the daemon runs it; `src/plans/*` in the app) |
| Your Mac (BLG-47): one conversation with your own agent for the whole Mac, not one project, the same on the phone and the Mac (the `assistant` view, channel `mac:assistant`). It runs in ~/.beluga/assistant/work (its scratch folder's files are its outputs on the phone; its session and history beside it stay secret), with your usual approvals, and its tools (`mcp__beluga_mac__*`: `screenshot`, `device_info`, `list_work`, `start_worktree`, `start_task`, `start_plan`, `archive_worktree`) plus the board's. Since BLG-565 it archives a worktree you ask it to, through `workspaces.archive` (lossless and restorable; a worktree with Claude still working waits for your yes). What it starts it names as `worktree:<id>`, `task:<KEY>`, `plan:<id>`, drawn as links on both screens. Since BLG-102 it holds several chats, tabs above its conversation on the Mac (the `assistant` view's `chat`; channels `mac:assistant` for the first, `mac:assistant:<id>` for the others; the shared state's `assistant`): + starts one, × deletes one for good after asking (no archive), and the open tab is kept across restarts (~/.beluga/assistant/chats.json; each chat's session and history in `chats/<id>/`, the old single chat moved into `chats/main/`) | Mac (the sidebar's top row, `layout/AssistantNav.tsx`; the tabs, `chat/AssistantTabs.tsx`; core: `src/core/assistant/`, `src/agent/mac-tools.ts`); phone (the Ask sheet's first target and Home's Ask your Mac: the chat open on the Mac; its other chats by name where conversations are listed) |
| Web access (BLG-649, BLG-650, docs/web.md): the daemon serves the whole UI to browsers on its own web port (127.0.0.1:7777; `beluga web --listen host:port --allow-host name`), apart from the token socket; a browser is let in once by a join link (`/join#<secret>`, 10 minutes, one use) and keeps an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie (only its hash kept, in ~/.beluga/web-sessions.json); without one it gets only the Ask for a link page and no socket; revoking one cuts it off at once; the port reopens at each start until closed (~/.beluga/web.json) — the `web.*` API | Mac (Settings › Advanced › Web access, `dialogs/WebAccessSettings.tsx`; core: `src/daemon/web*.ts`); the browser shows the Mac app's own UI |
| Graphs the agent draws (`beluga-graph` blocks: interactive diagrams laid out by ELK and drawn with React Flow, in answers, reports and Markdown files; hover, details, walkthrough, full window) | Mac (`components/graph/*`; the format is `src/shared/graph-spec.ts`, the agent learns it from `agent/graph-prompt.ts`) |
| Views the agent shows (`beluga-view` blocks and the `show` tool: tables, charts, stats, code, colors; live from a file, folder, SQLite, Postgres, a web address or a command, paged, sorted and searched without the agent) | Mac (`components/views/*`; the format is `src/shared/view-spec.ts`, sources run in `core/views/sources.ts`, the agent learns it from `agent/view-prompt.ts`) |
| Mention grammar (BLG-443): `@bob` asks bob's default agent, `@bob:codex` one of theirs, `@agents` everyone's default; `@claude`, `@claude:bob` and `@claudes` stay aliases (a person named claude is `@claude:claude`, with a hint); a mistyped name gets "Did you mean @bob?" and a person with no published default gets their Claude, each said in a toast; the request carries the agent (`agent_request.agent`) | both (core: `core/mentions.ts` `parseInput`, `core/session.ts` `submit`; the phone sends what you type through the same `submit`) |
| Agent tags in the room (BLG-520): "@" lists your own agents that run here (`@codex`) and each person's that their card lists (`@bob:codex`, `@bob:claude`), each with its mark; a named agent rides the room ask (`agent_request.agent`, only for `@codex` / `@bob:codex`, not `@bob` or the `@claude…` aliases) and their Mac runs it when its card lists it and it runs there (yours: any that runs here), else their default with `agent_event.fallback`; the asker's room gets a line when another agent answers (not set up there, or an older Mac); the answer is labelled with the agent that ran | both (core: `shared/agent-tags.ts` `roomAgentTags`, `core/agent-host.ts` `pickNamed`, `core/session.ts` `sayWhoAnswers`; Mac: the room's composer list, `chat/Suggestions.tsx` marks; phone: `ConvView.tags` as chips over the room's message box, `components/Composer.tsx`) |
| Your default agent (BLG-444): who answers `@you`, in Settings › Agent ("Answers when friends write @you") and per project in its Settings sheet (`session.setPrefs` `defaultAgent` / `projectAgents`; a project's wins, `core/settings.ts` `chosenAgent`); published on your peer card (`defaultAgent`, `agents`) at once, without reconnecting | Mac (`dialogs/Settings.tsx`, `dialogs/native/ProjectSettingsSheet.tsx`, choices from `ui/agent-choice.ts`); the phone shows friends' defaults it gets on their cards |
| A chat's family on the phone (BLG-172): Work's rows show each chat's harness mark and a child under its parent; a chat's ••• › Threads has its parent, its children, their live state and Stop, and its native sub-agents as read-only rows in the same list (no Stop; `ThreadFamilyView.agents`); a need in a child names it. Off with Agent threads off | Phone (`app/(tabs)/work.tsx`, `components/ThreadsSheet.tsx`, `src/companion/thread-family.ts`); the Mac's sidebar and Right panel › Threads |
| Agent threads (BLG-171): Settings › Advanced › Agent threads turns the thread tools on (`session.setPrefs` `agentThreads`, off by default; the next run has them or not), and Settings › Agent › Thread limits sets `threadLimits` (depth, working in one tree, kept in one tree, working on this computer; the next `thread_start` reads them). No agent tool writes them | Mac (`dialogs/AgentThreadsSettings.tsx`); settings stay Mac-only, so the phone has neither |
| A chat with threads (BLG-170): its archive and delete dialogs ask once whether its threads go too (`workspaces.archive` / `workspaces.remove` `children: 'with' \| 'keep'`; archive's default is with, delete's is keep; with `with`, a picked row under another picked row gets no call of its own, `lib/thread-family.ts` `batchCalls`). The usage card's Archive, typed `/archive` and `/delete`, and the sidebar's chat selection keep the threads and ask nothing | Mac (`dialogs/native/ThreadsChoice.tsx`, in the confirm alert, Overview's delete and the Worktrees view's `BatchAlert`); the phone's Archive and Delete sheets ask the same question with the same defaults (`companion.branchStep`'s third argument, `BranchView.threads`) |
| Continuing after a usage limit (BLG-757): a run that stopped on your plan's usage limit is told “Continue where you left off.” a minute after the limit resets (30 minutes after it stopped when the reset isn't known), on by default, in worktrees, project chats, Your Mac's chats and the Sentinel chat, never in the room, DMs or groups, nor a sentinel run's chat (the sentinel runs again itself), nor into an archived worktree or hours late (`core/auto-continue.ts`; plans resume their own with the same switches, `core/plans/watchdog.ts`). The limit card says when it sends and offers Don't Send › For This Session / Never in This Chat / Everywhere; turned off, it shows Continue and Send at HH:MM to undo (`session.setPrefs` `autoContinue` / `autoContinueOff` / `autoContinueSkip`, rules in `shared/auto-continue.ts`) | Mac (`chat/Items.tsx` LimitResume, Settings › Agent › Usage limits in `dialogs/UsageLimitSettings.tsx`); the phone says “Continues on its own at HH:MM” under the card (`TurnView.resumesAt`, 1.42), read-only |
| Your computers (docs/machines.md): the Runs on chip beside the mode and model wherever work is made (the chat's box, a project's home, New Plan, New Sentinel), This Mac, each computer with its line or why it can't take the work, and Best Available; the last pick remembered per project; shown only once a computer is paired | both (Mac: `chat/RunsOn.tsx`, rows from `machines/runs-on-model.ts`; phone: New Task › Runs on, the same lines from `src/machines/words.ts`) |
| A computer's work in this app: its worktrees in the sidebar with its mark (On your computers), its name in the toolbar with Slow or Reconnecting, its notices in the one bell and the Dock, each saying which computer | Mac (`machines/MachineTag.tsx`, `machines/RemoteRows.tsx`, `src/machines/attention.ts`); the phone lists them under Work › Your Computers and Needs You |
| An offline computer: its last state and the files you read, kept on this Mac (capped), open read-only until it's back; calls that need it say so at once | Mac (`src/machines/cache.ts`, `src/machines/files.ts`); the phone reads its own copy, greyed |

## Adding a feature

1. The API: an entry in `src/ipc/api.ts` and its handler in `src/ipc/handlers.ts`.
2. The behavior in the core, with a contract test in `tests/contract/` (runs in process and over the daemon's socket).
3. Model or action code in `src/ui/*-models.ts` / `*-actions.ts` / `menus.ts` (keep it browser-safe: `tests/browser-safe.test.ts`).
4. The Mac app's pixels (`packages/mac/src`).
5. A row on this page.
6. Command, palette, menu bar and help entries.
