# Every way in, and where the Mac app shows it

The Mac app drives Beluga's core through `src/ipc/api.ts`. This page lists every way in and where you find it in the app. `tests/parity.test.ts` fails when a command, a UI action, a menu or an API method exists without a row here.

Columns: **Core** is the API method or intent it uses; **Mac** is where you find it.

## Sending while Claude works, and images

| What | Core | Mac |
|---|---|---|
| Queue a message (the default while your Claude works) | `session.submit` | Return · the split button's **Queue** |
| Steer: Claude reads it at its next step without stopping (a run that can't take it: stop it, run this next) | `session.submit` with `urgent` | Option+Return · the split button's **Steer** |
| What waits, in run order (text, who asked) | `queueIn` (`src/ui/compose.ts`), the prompt comes with the `queued` event | the queue above the box |
| Run a waiting message now (steering, as above) | `host.promote` | queue › Steer |
| A steered message Claude hasn't read yet: sent, not read (its card is a note till Claude reads it: `READS_AFTER_STEP`, `STOPPING_FOR`, then `STEERED_IN` or its own turn) | `steerWaiting` (`src/shared/claude-notices.ts`), the message's `request` | your message dimmed, a clock and “Sent · waiting for Claude to read it” |
| Send it now: Claude's step stops (its interrupt, as Stop does) and the conversation goes on from your message | `host.steerNow` | **Send now** on that message · ⇧⌥↩ |
| Drop a waiting message | `host.cancelQueued` | queue › ✕ |
| Edit a waiting message (back into the box) | `host.cancelQueued`, then the box | queue › ✎ |
| Change the order | `host.reorderQueued` (yours only; friends' keep their places) | queue › ↑ ↓ |
| Paste or drop an image | `attachments.add` | ⌘V / drop: a chip plus its picture above the text |
| An image in a message | `attachments.read` (yours from disk, a friend's through their share) | the picture (several in a grid); click for full size, ⌘C copies, Open shows it in Preview |

## Beyond the shared actions

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Window vibrancy, menu bar, menu-bar icon, `beluga://` links, Settings window, ⌘K palette, drag-and-drop images | Mac |
| A workspace's screen: the conversation always in the center; a right panel (⌥⌘0, resizable, its tab remembered per workspace; in two panes split where you drag it: what Claude made on top (Changes, Files, Scratch, Info) and what runs below (Terminal, Background; it folds to its tabs); drag a tab to the other pane or right-click › Move to Bottom / Top, Reset Panel Layout; tabs always named; History is Changes' second view; a dot on Scratch when Claude saves something new) with Changes (files with +/−, the diff inline or the file as itself — Markdown formatted, pictures and PDFs always as themselves — Show in Files, Commit / PR / Review), Files (a tree you filter by name, a preview with PDFs drawn page by page, Show Changes on a changed file), Terminal (the workspace's shells, setup and run) and Info (the inspector); a calm toolbar (what the workspace needs next, Run, ⋯ in sections: git steps, the conversation, the folder, putting it away; then Search, the bell, the panel); ⌘J types in the terminal, and puts it away when you're already typing there; Claude's steps fold away once it answers (Show Steps on the answer, Settings › Chat to keep them); ⌘J's terminal in that panel or a drawer under the chat; a diff, file or the terminal in full for a while (⌘↩, Esc back) | Mac (`layout/RightPanel.tsx`, `layout/panel/*`, `lib/panel.ts`) |
| Dock badge, clicking a desktop notification to go where it's about | Mac |
| Marking one notification unread again | Mac (hover a notification) |
| First-run welcome: an eight-part animated tour (parallel worktrees, live agents, the table weave: Claude picks Postgres, connects and answers with a real, sortable table view, friends, Sentinel: a sentence becomes a sentinel (its trigger, steps and access, turned on, run step by step, its report) for five real ones you can pick, then Sentinel at work: its page's films with the sentence that sets each up, earnings, archive), then the look, the message box’s fire (Arcade, Ghost or None, tried in a live box) and a few shared settings; the macOS permissions one a step, each optional (Not Now, Skip Permissions) with why in a sentence, whether Beluga has it, and a button to its System Settings pane: Screen Recording, Accessibility, Full Disk Access, Automation (`privacy_access`, `privacy_request` in `src-tauri/src/privacy.rs`); notifications (allowed or not); the Android phone app with Pair a Phone… (`companion.pair.start`) and where to get it; once per Mac, never after an update; Help › Welcome to Beluga shows it again | Mac (`onboarding/*`, `lib/privacy.ts`) |
| Local UI preferences (appearance, accent, text size, density, widths) | Mac (`lib/prefs.ts`) |
| Terminal look (font, size, line height, cursor style and blink, scrollback) | Mac (`lib/prefs.ts`, Settings › Terminal) |
| Environment variable editor (masked values, paste KEY=value lines, per-project scope; a project's main folder .env loads by default and shows beside its own variables, each marked where it comes from, an edit to a .env one overriding it and Use .env undoing that, Keep a Copy in Beluga) | Mac (Settings › Environment; a project's ••• › Environment… and its page's Environment pill: `dialogs/EnvironmentSheet.tsx`) |
| A worktree changed a .env the main folder doesn't have: an env bar (its keys as +added ~changed −removed tags) with Copy to Main Folder and Keep Here, on the project page and in the worktree; untouched copies follow the main folder's .env on their own | Mac (`views/project/EnvAsks.tsx`) |
| Confirmations as alerts (archive/delete with “Commit & Archive” and an env-changes table, clear, agent worktrees, hide project, leave a shared workspace), each with Cancel | Mac (`dialogs/native/*Alert.tsx`, `components/Alert.tsx`) |
| Inviting, people and sharing as sheets and cards: the Invite People sheet (Invite to popup, Watch / Prompt / Edit, Copy Invite Link with “Copied”, people waiting, active links with Copy and Revoke), a person's card beside their row (trust as a segmented control, Message / Ask Claude / Run / Follow / Files, usage meters, Remove with an alert), your account card (rename in place, who may use your Claude), a right-click Trust ▸ submenu, the Share sheet for a workspace (an access popup per person), Share a Folder (Open panel, your projects, only some people, Claude may edit, Stop Sharing), the room's card from the sidebar's status | Mac (`dialogs/native/InviteSheet.tsx`, `PersonPopover.tsx`, `PersonCards.tsx`, `PersonMenu.tsx`, `WorkspaceShare.tsx`, `ShareFolderSheet.tsx`, `SharedSheet.tsx`, `RoomPopover.tsx`) |
| Addressing a message with a chip (“To bob”, “To bob's Claude”, “To your Claude”) | Mac (`MacUi.to`, the composer) |
| Run a command on a friend's computer from a sheet with a command field | Mac (`dialogs/native/PeerSheets.tsx`) |
| Search over a workspace shared with you (names and contents) above its Files, instead of a read-only shell tab | Mac (`views/SharedSearch.tsx`) |
| A shared workspace's earlier conversation drawn as people's messages | Mac (`lib/said.ts`, from each line's `said`) |
| Clicking an invite link (`beluga://<key>…#secret`) opens the Join sheet | Mac (`lib/native.ts` `inviteOf`) |
| Forms instead of typing in the message box: fork name, project Setup/Run (with where each comes from, and “Save to beluga.json”: `workbench.setScript(…, team)`), PR with extra instructions, new template with Plan first (`workbench.saveTemplate(…, plan)`), hand off, a worktree or a command on a friend's computer, the model, the welcome choice | Mac (`dialogs/native/`, `lib/native-routes.ts`) |
| Groups in the sidebar: Move to Group ▸ submenu, a new group named in place, rename, ungroup (`workspaces.renameGroup`, `workspaces.ungroup`), drag a project onto a group or out of it | Mac (`layout/ProjectGroups.tsx`) |
| Arranging the sidebar Finder-style: drag projects to reorder them (an insertion line, the list scrolls near its edges, Esc puts it back), drop one on a group (the folder lights up; a folded one springs open) or between a group's projects, pull it out to the top level, drag groups among the projects; Move Up / Move Down (⌃⌘↑/↓) in a row's menu; empty groups you make stay until you delete them (`workspaces.arrange`, `workspaces.newGroup`; the order lives in projects.json's `order` and each group's list, see `src/workspaces/arrange.ts`). Project rows don't fold (their worktrees and chats always show, never the main checkout; clicking one opens the project); groups fold, with a count | Mac (`layout/ProjectTree.tsx`, `layout/arrange-drag.ts`, `layout/project-layout.ts`) |
| Hiding a project with Undo (“Hidden api — Undo”, ⌘Z) instead of an alert; Hidden Projects folded at the bottom of the sidebar, in Settings › Workspaces and in the Add Projects sheet, each with Show (`workspaces.showProject`; it comes back in its place and group) | Mac (`layout/ProjectTree.tsx`, `lib/undo-toast.tsx`) |
| “Connect GitHub” with copyable commands and Check Again (`workbench.refreshPrs(id, true)` looks for gh again) | Mac (PR sheet) |
| Stop your Claude in one conversation (`host.stopRun`): your queued messages there come back into the box, other people's requests keep their places and run next, other conversations carry on | Mac (■ Stop beside the send control, ⌘., Conversation › Stop Claude, Stop on a running answer) |
| Workspace and Conversation menus in the menu bar (Commit… ⇧⌘C, Pull Request… ⇧⌘P, Merge… ⇧⌘M, Run ⌘R, Ask Claude to Review… ⇧⌘R, Archive… ⌃⌘A, Stop ⌘., Plan First ⌥⌘P, Find ⌘F / ⌘G / ⇧⌘G, Clear ⇧⌘K, Previous/Next Workspace ⌥⌘↑/↓), greyed out when they can't run (`lib/commands.ts`, `set_menu_state`); what starts Claude or changes git (Review, Commit, Merge, Solve Conflict, Compact, Fix Checks) says what it will do and waits for Start, from every way in (a popover under its toolbar button, else an alert; `lib/work-confirm.ts`) | Mac |
| A calm sidebar: Overview, Work (Tasks, Issues and Plans in one row, a Tasks · Issues · Plans switch over each list, running plans under it) and Group chat at the top, always; Activity only while it's live and Requests only while one is unanswered (answered ones are tucked behind Show answered on the Requests page); Files (folders friends and the room share, grouped by person) as a row of its own, and projects friends share in Projects (there is no Shared with me any more); Search in the toolbar (⇧⌘F); Usage as an icon above the sidebar (amber when most of the week is used); the terminal in the right panel (⌘J). The places in order (Overview, Tasks, Chat, Search, Usage, Terminal, Files) for ⌘1…7, ⌃Tab, the Go menu and the palette (`lib/go.ts`) | Mac |
| The toolbar's main button chosen from the workspace's state (Commit / Merge / PR #n / Fix Checks / Solve Conflict / Restore / Run), the rest as icons and a ⋯ menu with shortcuts (`layout/toolbar-actions.ts`) | Mac |
| Find in a conversation (⌘F) | Mac (`chat/FindBar.tsx`) |
| Your own keyboard shortcuts (BLG-289): Settings › Keyboard (Help › Keys and Commands, ⌘/, ⌘K › Keyboard Shortcuts…) lists every shortcut by section; click a key and press the new one, + for another key, × to take one away, ↺ back to its own, Reset All with Undo; a key something else has offers Swap / Use Here / Cancel (↩ / esc), what macOS keeps (⌘Q, ⌘C…) and keys that would type are refused with why; find a shortcut by name or by pressing its keys (and see a key is free). The window, the pages' own keys, the message box, requests, the sidebar, the talk shortcut, the menu bar's accelerators (`set_menu_keys`, off while recording), tooltips and the palette all follow; kept on this Mac (`prefs.shortcuts`) | Mac (`lib/shortcuts-model.ts`, `lib/shortcuts.ts`, `dialogs/KeyboardSettings.tsx`) |
| Right-click menus: messages (Copy, Copy as Markdown, Quote in Reply, Ask Claude About This, Open Image), code blocks, files (Open, Show in Finder, Copy Path, Mention in Chat, Save a Copy…), changed files and commits in Diff, search results, Usage rows, notifications | Mac |
| Save a shared file where you choose (`files.download` with `to`, the Save panel) | Mac |
| A new worktree's form: Based on (`workspaces.branches`), Name, Create Worktree (`workspaces.startWorktree` with `base` / `name`) | Mac |
| No standing main conversation per project (BLG-70): a project's conversations are the chats and worktrees you start; the main checkout is the project's home (Update main, Fetch, Merge into main, its terminal), not a conversation. Nothing lists or opens it as one (sidebar, Overview, ⌘K, @mentions, the project menu, notifications, the phone's Work and Open on your Mac go to its home or the chat it became), and Claude never runs in it on its own. Once, at startup, a main conversation from before becomes an ordinary chat in its project with its history, Claude session, model and usage, named after its first message (`workspaces/main-migration.ts`; an empty one goes) | both (core: `workspaces/main-migration.ts`, `client/screen.ts` `viewFor`, `core/workspace-controller.ts`; Mac: `lib/project-home.ts` `newChatProject`) |
| Never change main: every Claude run in a project's main folder (the main checkout, or a chat there) is questions only. Edits, writes and shell commands that aren't clearly read-only are denied (`agent/policy.ts` `askOnly`, `agent/read-only.ts`), Claude is told so, and a change request makes it call `continue_in_worktree`: a new worktree from the latest origin, named after the task, and the chat itself becomes that worktree (same conversation and Claude session, now in the worktree's folder), and the work goes on there (your own requests move right away; someone else's ask you first) | both (core) |
| A project's home (`project` view): icon, name, main's branch and how it compares with origin, counts (active / ready to merge / archived, earnings), “What do you want to do in …?” with New Worktree (Based on, Name) or Just Ask, then its worktrees, questions and recently archived (Show All in Overview), and last (with Stripe connected) its Earnings as one folded row: earned in the last 7 / 30 / 90 days, payments and paying customers, each against the span before, and the last payment; unfolded (both kept), the range, a bar per day and the latest payments (All / Refunds / Failed, New for what arrived while shown, Show All, Open Stripe; Stripe Earnings… for the sheet). Clicking a project opens it | Mac (`views/ProjectHome.tsx`, `lib/project-home.ts`) |
| Keeping main current and seeing history: the project home is about the default branch (main or master, “3 behind origin/main”, and “The main folder is on feat/…” with Switch to main), Update main and Fetch with when it last fetched, a quiet fetch of every project every ~15 min (never a password prompt: GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0), uncommitted changes in the way (stash and put back, or move to a worktree), anything else to Claude in a run whose only permission beyond reading is syncing git (`agent/sync-main.ts`; never push, never discard), the GitHub row, and History (a commit graph with lanes and merges, authors as initials, refs as pills, filters, a commit's diffs; `views/history/*`) | Mac (`views/project/MainSyncBar.tsx`, `views/project/GitHubRow.tsx`, `views/history/*`, `layout/panel/HistoryTab.tsx`; core: `core/main-sync.ts`, `workspaces/sync.ts`, `workspaces/history.ts`, `workspaces/github.ts`) |
| A questions-only chat: “Questions only — Claude won’t change anything in main.” above the box, Continue in New Worktree… as the toolbar's main button, “Ask about <project>…” in the box | Mac (`chat/AskBanner.tsx`, `dialogs/native/ContinueSheet.tsx`) |
| Sub-agents: under the conversation that started them in the sidebar (a robot, running first, “N more”), their own worktrees as the agent (never as your worktrees; old ones no conversation here started aren’t listed, Clean Up Worktrees… has them), the sub-agent page (who started it, type, model, effort, time, steps, context; its live transcript with thinking and tools; its worktree's Changes, Files and Scratch beside it; Send to Main Claude to steer it through its lead), Watch on a sub-agent in the chat | Mac (`src/layout/SubAgents.tsx`, `src/claude-code/AgentMonitor.tsx`) |
| Chats with friends: tabs above the conversation (All Friends first; open, close, + for a new channel), files shared Mac to Mac (cards, pictures, progress, Open / Show in Finder / Save As), Claudes called in with the Ask Claude menu (answers marked “bob’s Claude”, “… is answering”), Settings › People & access › Who can ask your Claude in chats; a task between two people's Claudes as a live card in their DM or channel (BLG-208), your own Claude acting there with its tools, its "Ask Alice's Claude?" cards, approvals and questions above the message box, and friends' requests approved on their card (BLG-207) | Mac (`src/network/ChatTabs.tsx`, `ChatFiles.tsx`, `NetComposer.tsx`, `ConversationView.tsx`) |
| Friends, direct messages, groups and your status (the Beluga network): sidebar Friends and Groups with presence and unread, the Add a Friend sheet (code, link, QR; `beluga://add` / `beluga://join` links), conversations (`conversation` view), New Group / Add People sheets, group info (members, admins, invite link, join requests, rename, leave), the status menu in the sidebar and the menu bar, Away when idle, Settings › People & access switch | Mac (`src/network/*`) |
| Empty states with one-click starters (New Worktree, New Chat, Add Projects…, first tasks for Claude) | Mac |
| The palette's commands as named actions (“Create Pull Request…”, “Fork This Workspace…”), never `/cmd <arg>` | Mac (`dialogs/palette-commands.ts`) |
| The Beluga network: friends added once by a one-time link or a short code, direct messages that wait for offline friends, groups that live on their members' Macs (no host, end-to-end encrypted, admins add and remove people, join by link), and your status (online, away, do not disturb, appear offline) — the `network.*` API and the shared state's `network` | Mac (the daemon runs it when `network: true` is in settings or `BELUGA_NETWORK=1`; `src/net/mesh/`, `src/core/network.ts`) |
| Earnings from Stripe per project: a key per project (kept in ~/.beluga/stripe.json, 0600; screens only get `earnings`: connected, the account's name, all-time totals per currency, what it did lately (`activity`: the last 180 days' earnings per day, distinct paying customers per 7 / 30 / 90 days and the span before, the latest 25 payments with a first name and initial or a masked email, never more), when they were counted, what went wrong), counted in the background (a quick look for new payments every 10 minutes, the last months read again when something came in or once a day, a full recount weekly), shown as a pill beside each project in the sidebar (a new payment: it hops, and pixel-art confetti bursts from it; none with reduced motion), as the Earnings section of the project's home, and as a card in the Overview and the Usage view, every total in one currency (`prefs.earningsCurrency`, "Show earnings in" in Settings › General and the Stripe sheet; unset: the one most was earned in), other currencies converted at the ECB's daily rates (`src/core/fx-rates.ts`, `fx` in the shared state, fetched alongside the daily Stripe count) — the `stripe.*` API and the shared state's `earnings` | Mac (`src/core/stripe-earnings.ts` and `stripe-activity.ts`, the daemon runs them; `components/EarningsPill.tsx`, `components/PixelBurst.tsx` and `pixel-burst-model.ts`, `views/project/EarningsSection.tsx`, `dialogs/StripeSheet.tsx`, `lib/earnings.ts`) |
| Supporting Beluga: worktrees Beluga made that end up merged (Merge into main, a pull request merged on GitHub, or git finding the branch's own commits in the default branch: archived worktrees too, and a deleted one just before its branch goes) count once per branch, kept in ~/.beluga/support.json; the first merge brings a Star sheet with pastel confetti (none with reduced motion) asking for a star on GitHub, the fifth a coffee sheet with the maker as a GitHub chip (5 / 10 / 20 / 50 USD or another amount, each a Stripe Payment Link; Not Now asks once more five merges later, Don't Ask Again never), both once; Settings › About › Support Beluga has them any time — the `support.*` API and the shared state's `support`. The phone never asks | Mac (`src/core/merge-counter.ts`, `src/core/support-store.ts`, the daemon runs it; `dialogs/SupportSheets.tsx`, `components/Confetti.tsx`, `lib/support.ts`) |
| Claude Code running outside Beluga, live and read-only: sessions you run through Conductor or a terminal, and their sub-agents (description, type, running / finished / failed / stopped / idle, the current step, steps, context), found by watching the transcripts Claude Code writes in ~/.claude/projects (never written to; tailed from the end, at most the last 200 steps per agent kept), in Activity (every live session by project, “6 agents running”), a strip above a workspace's chat and the Inspector's Claude Code panel (the session's folder is the workspace's, Conductor worktrees included), and a read-only transcript per session or agent; a background agent finishing notifies (`background`) — the `claudeCode.steps` API and the shared state's `claudeCode` (screens on this computer only, never sent to the room) | Mac (`src/core/claude-code/`, the daemon runs it; `src/claude-code/*` in the app) |
| The Worktrees page: every worktree in your projects (Beluga's, sub-agents', made outside Beluga) with who made it (a sub-agent's conversation, or that it's gone), whether its work is done, its size and what can be cleared; tick some, then Free Up Space (they stay) or Archive (everything of yours kept); the sidebar's Worktrees row, a project's Manage Worktrees… | Mac (`src/views/worktrees/`) |
| Tasks between Claudes (the gateway): your Claude finds who can help (`who_can`), asks their Claude (`ask_person`) or runs one command on their Mac (`run_on`), waits (`wait_for`) or ends its turn and continues when the answer comes back; you're asked first for people you don't trust (a card in the conversation), their side approves with today's approval cards unless they trust you; results go only to the requester, as data. Task cards in conversations, the Requests view (Sent / Received) — the `gateway.*` API and the shared state's `gateway` | Mac (`src/core/gateway/`, the daemon runs it; `src/gateway/*` in the app) |
| Tasks (the board): a Tasks place in the sidebar with My Tasks, Active, Backlog and All, by project; a list grouped by status, a board you drag cards across, and a graph of what waits on what (the graph engine); filtered by who or by the worktree doing or carrying them (a worktree's Info tab lists its tasks and opens the board filtered to it); a task's page (its title, properties, a brief in sections that Claude and you keep true with every version kept, sub-tasks, blockers, its worktree and pull request, proof, activity and comments); a task opens with every new worktree and follows its pull request (In Review when it opens, Done when it merges); Start on a task (or Start Worktree Only), Open Worktree when one already does or carries it; your Claude's runs in a task's worktree get its brief and the task tools (`mcp__beluga_board__*`) — the `board.*` API and the shared state's `board` | Mac (`src/core/board/`, the daemon runs it; `src/tasks/*` in the app) |
| GitHub issues: a project's issues in Beluga (the Issues place in the sidebar, an issue's page, the latest four on a project's home), read through gh with your own sign-in. One click hands one to Claude, always through a task, so it shows on the board and its pull request moves it along: Investigate (a worktree where Claude finds out why and reproduces it, its findings in the task's brief and on the issue's page, stopping before any fix), Fix It (there, or in a new worktree, with a pull request that says "Fixes #n"), Make a Task (written by Claude from the issue, or after a quick read-only look at the code). A task made from an issue links back to it (its page, its row, the strip above its conversation) and Claude's runs on it know the issue — the `issues.*` API and `Issue.github` | Mac (`src/core/issues/`, the daemon runs it; `src/issues/*` in the app); the phone sees the tasks, not the issues yet (BLG-170) |
| Team boards (BLG-220): friends with the same GitHub repository as a project on their own Macs find each other by a fingerprint keyed for the two of them (a friend who lacks the repository learns nothing), team up when both say yes, and keep one board for it; the team badge (teammates' avatars) on the project's row, Leave Team in its ••• — the `team.*` API and the shared state's `team` | Mac (`src/core/team/`, the daemon runs it with the board; `src/team/*` in the app); phone: the offer as a card |
| Sentinel (docs/sentinel.md, BLG-236): watchers that run on a schedule, by hand or after another sentinel, do a few steps in order (Ask Claude in the project, a worktree or Your Mac; Run a script with your environment; Notify me; Call a service with presets; Open a pull request; Merge if acceptable — checks, a review, your Merge; Message a chat; Ask a friend's Claude; Run another sentinel) and leave a report; your Claude sets one up or changes it (`sentinel.ask`); one run per sentinel at a time, at most Run at Once Claude steps together, a time limit, runs per day, pausing after failures in a row; missed slots caught up once or skipped; ~/.beluga/sentinel.json and each run's folder in ~/.beluga/sentinel/runs — the `sentinel.*` API, Claude's `mcp__beluga_sentinel__*` tools (`sentinel_stop` inside a run, `sentinel_list`, `sentinel_get`, `sentinel_create`, `sentinel_update`, `sentinel_run`, `sentinel_test`, `sentinel_try_source`, `sentinel_pause`, `sentinel_remove`) and the shared state's `sentinel` | Mac (`src/core/sentinel/`, the daemon runs it; the window's Sentinel section: the sidebar's Sentinel row, the list, a sentinel's page, a run's page, New Sentinel with its eleven recipes, ⌘K › Go to Sentinel and New Sentinel…, Go › Sentinel); the phone runs, pauses and reads runs (`sentinel.run`, `pause`, `runs`, `runGet`, `decide`) |
| The Sentinel chat (docs/sentinel.md §12, BLG-246): one conversation with your own Claude for the whole of Sentinel (several kept, one open), its system prompt telling how Sentinel works with the sentinels, dashboards and numbers as material, the `beluga_sentinel` and `beluga_dashboard` tools; creating, changing and running without asking, deleting a sentinel or a dashboard always asking your approval; quiet (not in the sidebar's chats, Unread or notifications); ~/.beluga/sentinel/chat — the `sentinel.chat*` API, the `sentinel-chat:<id>` channels, the shared state's `sentinel.chats` | Mac (Sentinel › Chat: the app's own chat with its bar, New Chat, ⋯ › Clear and Delete Chat…; ⌘K › Go to Sentinel Chat); the phone's Sentinel screen › Chat opens it as a conversation it writes and answers in (`SentinelsView.chat`, `companion.ask`) |
| Numbers and dashboards (docs/sentinel.md §10, BLG-244, reworked in BLG-246): a Keep the numbers step (`measure`: from the step before, a view source, or Claude's `sentinel_measure`) keeps named numbers, series (a whole array), rows or a step's output per run in ~/.beluga/sentinel/metrics/<sentinel>/<name>.jsonl (two years or 20 000 points); the state carries each metric's last 90 points and last rows; dashboards in ~/.beluga/dashboards.json — the `dashboard.*` API and `sentinel.metricRead`, Claude's `mcp__beluga_dashboard__*` tools (`sentinel_measure` inside a run, `dashboard_list`, `dashboard_create`, `dashboard_update`, `dashboard_remove` (asks you), `dashboard_add_tile`, `dashboard_update_tile`, `dashboard_move_tile`, `dashboard_remove_tile`, `metric_list`, `metric_read`), six number recipes | Mac (a sentinel's page › Numbers above History; Sentinel's Dashboard tab (Sentinels · Dashboard · Chat at the top of the Sentinel page; ⌘K › Go to Dashboard and Go › Dashboard land there): tile kinds number, series, table, output, text and divider, sized and retitled from a tile's ⋯, its tabs, compare, Refresh, Add a Tile by description (a draft sentinel when nothing fetches it yet) or picked, drag; New Sentinel › Recipe › Keep the numbers); the phone's `dashboard:<id>` screen with compare chips and pull to refresh, Home's row of the first dashboard's first three numbers (`dashboard.refresh`, `sentinel.metricRead`) |
| Plans: milestones with pass criteria and parallel tasks, drafted by Claude in a conversation and kept off the board until approved; a live plan graph and outline; Step by Step · Check-ins · Autopilot run by a scheduler that starts worktrees and asks Claude to check each milestone; the composer's Plan with Tasks — the `plans.*` API, Claude's `mcp__beluga_plan__*` tools and the shared state's `plans` | Mac (`src/core/plans/`, the daemon runs it; `src/plans/*` in the app) |
| Your Mac (BLG-47): one conversation with your own Claude for the whole Mac, not one project, the same on the phone and the Mac (the `assistant` view, channel `mac:assistant`). It runs in ~/.beluga/assistant/work (its scratch folder's files are its outputs on the phone; its session and history beside it stay secret), with your usual approvals, and its tools (`mcp__beluga_mac__*`: `screenshot`, `device_info`, `list_work`, `start_worktree`, `start_task`, `start_plan`) plus the board's. What it starts it names as `worktree:<id>`, `task:<KEY>`, `plan:<id>`, drawn as links on both screens. Since BLG-102 it holds several chats, tabs above its conversation on the Mac (the `assistant` view's `chat`; channels `mac:assistant` for the first, `mac:assistant:<id>` for the others; the shared state's `assistant`): + starts one, × deletes one for good after asking (no archive), and the open tab is kept across restarts (~/.beluga/assistant/chats.json; each chat's session and history in `chats/<id>/`, the old single chat moved into `chats/main/`) | Mac (the sidebar's top row, `layout/AssistantNav.tsx`; the tabs, `chat/AssistantTabs.tsx`; core: `src/core/assistant/`, `src/agent/mac-tools.ts`); phone (the Ask sheet's first target and Home's Ask your Mac: the chat open on the Mac; its other chats by name where conversations are listed) |
| Graphs Claude draws (`beluga-graph` blocks: interactive diagrams laid out by ELK and drawn with React Flow, in answers, reports and Markdown files; hover, details, walkthrough, full window) | Mac (`components/graph/*`; the format is `src/shared/graph-spec.ts`, Claude learns it from `agent/graph-prompt.ts`) |
| Views Claude shows (`beluga-view` blocks and the `show` tool: tables, charts, stats, code, colors; live from a file, folder, SQLite, Postgres, a web address or a command, paged, sorted and searched without Claude) | Mac (`components/views/*`; the format is `src/shared/view-spec.ts`, sources run in `core/views/sources.ts`, Claude learns it from `agent/view-prompt.ts`) |

## Adding a feature

1. The API: an entry in `src/ipc/api.ts` and its handler in `src/ipc/handlers.ts`.
2. The behavior in the core, with a contract test in `tests/contract/` (runs in process and over the daemon's socket).
3. Model or action code in `src/ui/*-models.ts` / `*-actions.ts` / `menus.ts` (keep it browser-safe: `tests/browser-safe.test.ts`).
4. The Mac app's pixels (`packages/mac/src`).
5. A row on this page.
6. Command, palette, menu bar and help entries.
